# ADR-002: Use Flutter for Mobile Apps

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-10-18  
**Deciders**: Software Architect, Technical Lead, Project Manager

## Context

The Eucharist Understanding Platform aims to reach people wherever they are, including on mobile devices. Mobile apps are essential because:
- Many people prefer mobile apps for daily spiritual practices
- Push notifications can support daily prayer routines
- Offline functionality enables prayer without internet
- Native feel provides better user experience
- App store presence increases discoverability

We need a mobile development strategy that:
- Supports both iOS and Android platforms
- Delivers native-like performance and UX
- Enables rapid development with limited resources
- Maintains code quality and testability
- Allows for future scaling and feature additions
- Fits within the budget constraints of an open-source project

### Key Requirements
- Cross-platform development (iOS and Android)
- Offline-first architecture for core features
- Native performance for smooth animations
- Integration with backend API
- Push notifications support
- Local data storage
- Firebase Authentication integration
- Beautiful, accessible UI

## Decision

We will use **Flutter 3.16+** with **Dart** as the framework for mobile application development.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Flutter Application             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Presentation Layer                     │
│  - Screens/Pages                        │
│  - Widgets                              │
│  - State Management (Provider/Riverpod) │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Domain Layer                           │
│  - Business Logic                       │
│  - Use Cases                            │
│  - Models/Entities                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Data Layer                             │
│  - Repositories                         │
│  - Data Sources (Remote/Local)          │
│  - DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Infrastructure                         │
│  - API Client (Dio)                     │
│  - Local Database (Hive/SQLite)         │
│  - Firebase Services                    │
│  - Secure Storage                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Clean Architecture Implementation
Following Flutter clean architecture principles:
- **Presentation**: UI and state management
- **Domain**: Business logic, independent of implementation
- **Data**: Implementation of repositories, data sources

## Consequences

### Positive

✅ **Single Codebase**: One codebase for both iOS and Android reduces development time by approximately 40% compared to native development

✅ **Native Performance**: Flutter compiles to native code, providing 60fps animations and smooth user experience comparable to native apps

✅ **Rich UI Components**: Extensive widget library with Material Design and Cupertino (iOS-style) widgets out of the box

✅ **Hot Reload**: Instant code changes during development dramatically speed up iteration

✅ **Strong Type System**: Dart's sound type system catches errors at compile time

✅ **Large Community**: Active community with extensive packages on pub.dev

✅ **Google Support**: Backed by Google with consistent updates and long-term commitment

✅ **Fast Development**: 
- Pre-built widgets
- Excellent tooling
- Clear documentation
- Good testing framework

✅ **Cost Effective**: Significantly reduces development and maintenance costs compared to maintaining two native codebases

✅ **Consistent UI**: Same look and feel across platforms (can be customized per platform if needed)

✅ **Good Firebase Integration**: Official Firebase plugins work well with Flutter

### Negative

⚠️ **Larger App Size**: Flutter apps are typically 4-5MB larger than equivalent native apps due to Flutter engine inclusion

⚠️ **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Dart and Flutter framework (though Dart is relatively easy for developers with Java/JavaScript experience)

⚠️ **Platform-Specific Features**: Some platform-specific features require writing native code or waiting for package updates

⚠️ **Debugging Native Issues**: Debugging platform-specific issues can be more challenging than pure native development

⚠️ **Package Quality Variance**: Third-party packages vary in quality and maintenance status

⚠️ **Widget Tree Complexity**: Deep widget trees can become hard to maintain without proper structure

### Neutral

➖ **Framework Dependency**: Tied to Flutter's release cycle and architectural decisions

➖ **Native Code Bridge**: Occasionally need to write platform-specific code for certain features

➖ **Build Times**: Initial builds can be slow, though hot reload compensates during development

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. React Native
**Pros**: 
- JavaScript/TypeScript (team may already know)
- Large ecosystem
- Good community
- Hot reload
- Expo framework simplifies development

**Cons**: 
- Bridge architecture can cause performance issues
- More platform-specific code needed
- Dependency on third-party native modules
- More configuration complexity
- Less consistent UI across platforms

**Why Not**: Flutter provides better out-of-the-box performance and more consistent cross-platform experience. React Native's bridge architecture introduces performance overhead that Flutter avoids with its compilation to native code.

### 2. Native Development (Swift/Kotlin)
**Pros**: 
- Best possible performance
- Full access to platform APIs
- No framework overhead
- Best debugging tools
- Platform-specific best practices

**Cons**: 
- Requires two completely separate codebases
- Double the development time and cost
- Need iOS and Android expertise
- Harder to maintain consistency
- Slower feature delivery

**Why Not**: With limited resources for an open-source project, developing and maintaining two codebases is not feasible. The 2x cost and time don't provide enough benefit over Flutter's near-native performance.

### 3. Xamarin
**Pros**: 
- C# language
- .NET ecosystem
- Native UI components
- Microsoft backing

**Cons**: 
- Smaller community than Flutter/React Native
- More complex setup
- Less popular (declining interest)
- Fewer resources and tutorials
- Limited future outlook

**Why Not**: Flutter has overtaken Xamarin in popularity and community support. The ecosystem is less vibrant, making it harder to find help and contributors.

### 4. Ionic/Capacitor
**Pros**: 
- Web technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- Can reuse web code
- Easy for web developers
- Fast development

**Cons**: 
- WebView-based (performance limitations)
- Not truly native feel
- Slower animations
- Limited access to native features
- Battery drain concerns

**Why Not**: For a spiritual app where user experience is paramount, the performance and native feel of Flutter are essential. WebView limitations would compromise the quality we want to deliver.

### 5. Progressive Web App (PWA) Only
**Pros**: 
- No app store approval needed
- Single codebase with web
- Easy updates
- Cross-platform by nature

**Cons**: 
- Limited offline capabilities
- No push notifications on iOS
- Poor app store discoverability
- Limited access to device features
- Less engagement than native apps

**Why Not**: Many Catholics looking for daily spiritual content expect native mobile apps. PWAs have significant limitations on iOS and lack the discovery benefits of app stores.
