   - Identify technical unknowns
   - Break down complex stories
   - Estimate technical complexity

2. **Technical Feasibility Assessment**
   - Validate against current architecture
   - Identify technical dependencies
   - Assess team capability
   - Estimate effort

3. **Technical Specifications**
   - Create technical specs for complex features
   - Define API contracts
   - Design database schema changes
   - Identify integration points

4. **Risk Identification**
   - Technical risks
   - Dependencies on external systems
   - Team skill gaps
   - Infrastructure needs

### Infrastructure Preparation (before sprint)

**Architect/Tech Lead Tasks**:

- [ ] Ensure development environment is ready
- [ ] Set up any new services or databases needed
- [ ] Configure feature flags if needed

- [ ] Ensure CI/CD pipeline is working

## Sprint Planning - Technical Component

### Sprint Planning Meeting

**Duration**: 2-4 hours

**Participants**: Product Owner, Project Manager, Software Architect, Technical Lead, Development Team

### Architect's Role in Sprint Planning

#### Part 1: Sprint Goal and Story Overview (30-60 min)

**Product Owner**: Presents sprint goal and prioritized stories

**Architect's Input**:
- Technical context for the sprint
- Architectural considerations
- Technical dependencies
- Infrastructure needs

**Example**:
```
"This sprint focuses on the Daily Gospel feature. From a technical 
perspective, we'll be:
1. Integrating with the USCCB API for readings
2. Implementing caching to reduce API calls
3. Creating the database schema for gospel_readings table
4. Building the REST endpoints for the frontend

Key architectural considerations:
- Cache strategy: Redis with 24-hour TTL
- Database: PostgreSQL for structured readings data
- API design: RESTful, following our established patterns
- Error handling: Graceful degradation if USCCB API is down"
```

#### Part 2: Story Estimation (60-90 min)

**Process**: Team estimates story points for each story

**Architect's Input**:
- Explain technical complexity
- Highlight non-obvious challenges
- Suggest technical approaches
- Break down technical tasks

**Story Breakdown Example**:

```markdown
## Story: Display Today's Gospel

### Technical Tasks:
1. Create gospel_readings table schema
2. Implement GospelService class
   - fetchFromUSCCB()
   - getTodaysGospel()
   - getGospelByDate()
3. Create API endpoints
   - GET /api/gospel/today
   - GET /api/gospel/:date
4. Implement caching layer
5. Create Gospel model and validation
6. Write unit tests for GospelService
7. Write integration tests for API
8. Update API documentation

### Technical Complexity Factors:
- External API integration (uncertainty)
- Caching implementation (medium)
- Database operations (low)
- Testing (medium)

### Estimated Points: 5
```

#### Part 3: Sprint Commitment (30-60 min)

**Team**: Commits to stories for the sprint

**Architect's Role**:
- Validate technical feasibility
- Ensure no overcommitment
- Confirm technical dependencies are understood
- Identify stories that need architecture review

## During Sprint Activities

### Daily Technical Support

**Architect Availability**:
- Attend standup 2-3 times per week
- Available for technical questions via Slack
- Scheduled office hours (2 hours, twice per week)
- Code review within 24 hours

### Technical Blockers

**When Developer is Blocked**:

1. **Developer**: Tries to resolve (30 min - 1 hour)
2. **Peer**: Seeks help from team member
3. **Technical Lead**: Escalates if unresolved
4. **Software Architect**: For architectural decisions

**Blocker Resolution Process**:
```
1. Identify blocker clearly
2. Document what's been tried
3. Bring to standup or Slack
4. Schedule quick call if needed (15-30 min)
5. Document solution for team
```
