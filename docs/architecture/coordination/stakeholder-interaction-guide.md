## Communication Best Practices

### General Principles

1. **Know Your Audience**: Adapt technical depth to stakeholder
2. **Focus on Value**: Always connect technical to business/user value
3. **Be Proactive**: Communicate early and often
4. **Be Transparent**: Share both progress and challenges
5. **Use Visuals**: Diagrams explain better than words
6. **Listen First**: Understand before explaining
7. **Document Decisions**: Use ADRs for major decisions
8. **Follow Up**: Written summaries after verbal discussions

### Technical Communication Tips

**When Explaining Complex Technical Concepts**:
1. Start with the "why" (business/user value)
2. Use analogies and metaphors
3. Show concrete examples
4. Use diagrams and visuals
5. Check for understanding
6. Provide written follow-up

**Example**:
❌ "We need to implement a Redis caching layer with TTL-based invalidation"

✅ "To make the app faster for users, we'll store frequently accessed data in memory so it loads instantly instead of querying the database each time. Think of it like keeping your most-used kitchen items on the counter instead of in the pantry."

### Conflict Resolution

**When Technical and Product Views Conflict**:

1. **Understand Both Perspectives**
   - What's the product goal?
   - What's the technical constraint?

2. **Find Common Ground**
   - Shared mission and values
   - User benefit as North Star

3. **Explore Alternatives**
   - Can we achieve 80% with less effort?
   - Is there a creative technical solution?
   - Can we phase the implementation?

4. **Make Trade-offs Explicit**
   - Option A: Fast but not scalable
   - Option B: Takes longer but scales
   - Option C: Compromise solution

5. **Escalate if Needed**
   - Bring in Project Manager
   - Document decision in ADR
   - Move forward aligned
