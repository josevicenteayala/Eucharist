# Technical Review Process

## Overview

This document defines the technical review process for the Eucharist Understanding Platform. It ensures code quality, architectural consistency, and knowledge sharing across the development team.

## Review Types

### 1. Code Review
**Purpose**: Ensure code quality, maintainability, and adherence to standards

**Scope**: All code changes before merging to main branches

**Reviewers**: 
- Primary: Peer developer
- Secondary: Technical Lead (for complex features)
- Tertiary: Software Architect (for architectural changes)

### 2. Design Review
**Purpose**: Validate technical design before implementation

**Scope**: Major features, architectural changes, database schema modifications

**Reviewers**: Technical Lead, Software Architect

### 3. Security Review
**Purpose**: Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities

**Scope**: Authentication/authorization, data handling, API endpoints, external integrations

**Reviewers**: Software Architect, Security specialist (if available)

### 4. Performance Review
**Purpose**: Ensure performance targets are met

**Scope**: Database queries, API endpoints, critical user flows

**Reviewers**: Software Architect, Technical Lead

## Code Review Guidelines

### When to Request Review

- [ ] Code is readable and maintainable

#### Architecture
- [ ] Follows established patterns
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Appropriate use of abstractions
- [ ] Database changes follow schema design

#### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests present and passing
- [ ] Test coverage meets minimum (80%)

### Review Response Time

- **Critical Bugs**: 2 hours
- **Regular PRs**: 24 hours
- **Documentation**: 48 hours
- **Draft PRs**: When reviewer has time

### How to Review Code

1. **Read the Description**: Understand the context and purpose
2. **Check the Tests**: Run tests locally if possible
3. **Review the Code**: Look for issues in the checklist
4. **Test Locally**: If significant changes, test the feature
5. **Provide Feedback**: Be constructive and specific
6. **Approve or Request Changes**: Clear communication

### Providing Feedback

#### Good Feedback Examples

✅ **Specific and Actionable**
```
Consider extracting this logic into a separate function for reusability.
This would also make it easier to test.

Suggestion:
```typescript
function validateEmail(email: string): boolean {
  // validation logic
}
```
```

✅ **Educational**
```
This works, but using Array.filter() here would be more idiomatic and 
performant than a for loop. Example: 
users.filter(u => u.age > 18)
```

✅ **Asks Questions**
```
Have we considered what happens if the API call fails? 
Should we add a retry mechanism or show a user-friendly error?
```

#### Feedback to Avoid

❌ **Vague**
```
This doesn't look right.
```

❌ **Prescriptive without Explanation**
```
Change this to use a Map instead.
```

❌ **Personal**
```
You always write messy code.
```

### Levels of Feedback

Use these prefixes to indicate severity:

- **[CRITICAL]**: Must be fixed before merge (security, bugs)
- **[IMPORTANT]**: Should be fixed before merge (quality, maintainability)
- **[SUGGESTION]**: Nice to have (optimization, alternative approach)
- **[QUESTION]**: Seeking clarification
- **[PRAISE]**: Acknowledging good work

Example:
```
[CRITICAL] This endpoint doesn't check user authentication. 
Please add the authMiddleware.

[SUGGESTION] Consider using async/await instead of .then() 
for better readability.

[PRAISE] Nice use of TypeScript generics here!
```

6. **Acknowledge Good Work**: Praise good practices

### For Developers

1. **Self-Review First**: Review your own code before submitting
2. **Keep PRs Small**: Aim for <400 lines of code
3. **Write Good Descriptions**: Explain context and approach
4. **Respond Promptly**: Address feedback quickly
5. **Ask Questions**: If you don't understand feedback, ask
6. **Don't Take It Personally**: Feedback is about code, not you

### For Both

1. **Focus on Code Quality**: Not personal preferences
2. **Be Respectful**: Professional and kind communication
3. **Seek Understanding**: Ask questions before criticizing
4. **Share Knowledge**: Review is a learning opportunity
5. **Balance Speed and Quality**: Fast reviews with thorough checks
