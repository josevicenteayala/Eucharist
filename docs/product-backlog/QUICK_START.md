## How to Use These Artifacts

### 1. Start with Personas (Week 1)
**Location**: `docs/product-backlog/personas/`

Read all four persona documents to deeply understand your users:

Each persona includes:
- Background and context
- Goals and pain points
- Key features they need
- Success indicators
- Design implications

- **Retention**: 40% 7-day, 50% 30-day

### Feature Usage
- **Daily Gospel**: 80% of DAU should view
- **Educational Content**: 3-5 articles per user per month
- **Community**: 20% of active users participating

### Content Quality
- **User Ratings**: 4.5+ stars average
- **Completion Rate**: 60%+ for articles
- **Theological Review**: 100% before publication

## Prioritization Framework

Use the **MoSCoW Method** from PRODUCT_OWNER.md:

- **Must Have**: Critical for MVP - cannot launch without
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical - Phase 2
- **Could Have**: Nice to have - Phase 3+
- **Won't Have**: Out of scope for now - future consideration

## Next Steps

1. **Share with Team**: Distribute this backlog to development team
2. **Schedule Sprint Planning**: Use Epic 1 stories for Sprint 1
3. **Recruit Content Team**: Need writers for daily reflections
4. **Engage Theological Advisor**: Content review process
5. **Define Success Metrics**: Set up analytics and tracking

- **3-5 points**: Small (1-2 days)
- **8 points**: Medium (3-5 days)
- **13 points**: Large (1-2 weeks)

### Priority Levels
1. **Must Have**: MVP/Phase 1
2. **Should Have**: Phase 2
3. **Could Have**: Phase 3+
