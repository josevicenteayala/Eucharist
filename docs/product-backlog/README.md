## Quick Start for Product Owner

### 1. Understanding Users
Start by reviewing the **personas/** directory to understand who you're building for:
- The Seeker (Maria) - Young professional exploring faith
- The Devoted Parent (John) - Teaching children about the Eucharist
- The Lifelong Learner (Patricia) - Seeking deeper theological understanding
- The RCIA Candidate (David) - Preparing to enter the Church

### 2. Reviewing the Roadmap
Check **roadmap/** to understand the product phases:
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-3)**: Foundation - MVP launch
- **Phase 2 (Months 4-6)**: Enhancement - Mobile app and expanded features
- **Phase 3 (Months 7-9)**: Growth - Scaling and community building
- **Phase 4 (Months 10-12)**: Maturity - Advanced features and optimization

### 3. Working with Epics
Epics are large bodies of work broken down into user stories:
- **Epic 1**: Daily Gospel & Reflection
- **Epic 2**: Eucharist Education
- **Epic 3**: Community Features

Each epic contains:
- Epic description and goals
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Priority and story point estimates
- Dependencies and technical notes

### 4. Using Templates
The **templates/** directory provides standardized formats for:
- Writing new user stories
- Creating new epics
- Defining acceptance criteria

## Prioritization Framework

### MoSCoW Method
- **Must Have**: Critical for MVP (Phase 1)
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical (Phase 2)
- **Could Have**: Nice to have (Phase 3)
- **Won't Have**: Out of scope for now

### Story Points Guide
- **1-2 points**: Very small, simple changes (hours)
- **3-5 points**: Small features (1-2 days)
- **8 points**: Medium features (3-5 days)
- **13 points**: Large features (1-2 weeks)
- **20+ points**: Too large, needs breaking down

## How to Add New Stories

1. Choose the appropriate **epic** file
2. Copy the user story template from **templates/user-story-template.md**
3. Fill in the story details:
   - User persona
   - Action/Goal
   - Benefit
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Priority level
   - Story points
4. Add to the epic file under the appropriate section
5. Update epic summary if needed

## Success Metrics

- **User Engagement**: DAU/MAU targets by phase
