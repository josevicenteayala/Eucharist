# Shared Code and Types

Shared TypeScript types, API contracts, and constants used across frontend, backend, and mobile applications.

## Structure

- `api-contracts/` - API interface definitions and request/response types
- `constants/` - Shared constants used across platforms
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions for common entities

## Purpose

This directory ensures type safety and consistency across all platforms by providing a single source of truth for:
- API request/response structures
- Domain entity types
- Shared enumerations and constants

**Note**: This is a planning directory. Implementation code has not been created yet.
